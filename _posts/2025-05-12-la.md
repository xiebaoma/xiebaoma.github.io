# Barcelona near LaLiga title with thrilling 4-3 win over Real Madrid

[Raphinha](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231050/Raphinha) scored twice as [Barcelona](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/83) overcame a two-goal deficit to secure a crucial 4-3 home victory against rivals [Real Madrid](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/86) in a pulsating Clasico on Sunday, edging them closer to the LaLiga title.

The victory extends Barcelona's lead at the top of the standings to seven points over second-place Real Madrid with three matches remaining. One more victory will clinch a 28th Spanish league title for the Catalans.

Barça earned a fourth consecutive victory over Madrid in all competitions this season, and their second in less than a month, in a chaotic match in which both sides showed their usual defensive weaknesses.

"In a game of this level you have to defend well and attack well," Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said after the match. "We attacked well, but in those 30 minutes we made some quite obvious mistakes. They cost us."

Barça seemed a much stronger and well organised team overall, dominating possession and creating several chances that were denied by an inspired keeper [Thibaut Courtois](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/134283/thibaut-courtois), who prevented Real's loss from being by a larger margin.

Hansi Flick's side can secure the LaLiga title as early as Wednesday, should [Real Madrid](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=86) fail to win at [Mallorca](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=84). However, regardless of Madrd's result, a Barcelona victory in their city derby against [Espanyol](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=88) on Thursday would guarantee the championship for the Catalans.

Madrid made a blistering start at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, with a brace from [Kylian Mbappé](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe) giving them a two-goal advantage.

He opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled inside the box by keeper [Wojciech Szczesny](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/131634/wojciech-szczesny) in the fifth minute and extended their lead with a quick counter nine minutes later from an assist by Vinicius Junior.

However, Barcelona responded swiftly with [Eric García](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/128714/eric-garcia), [Lamine Yamal](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/362150/lamine-yamal) and [Raphinha](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231050/raphinha) all finding the net within 15 minutes to overturn the deficit.

Garcia headed home from a corner in the 19th minute, while Yamal scored the equaliser in the 32nd with another brilliant display of technique as he curled a superb shot from the right corner of the box just outside Courtois' reach and inside the far post.

Two minutes later, a bad mistake by Mbappé in the midfield gifted Barca the ball, with Raphinha launching a quick counter and giving his side the lead with a tidy finish past a helpless Courtois.

"We have to defend better," Ancelotti added. "That's quite obvious, we defended badly, that's it. It's not about the low block. We gifted them some opportunities and they punished us."

Madrid thought they had earned a second penalty in the 43rd minute but it was overturned due to an offside in the build-up and, one minute later, a costly error by captain [Lucas Vázquez](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/174967/lucas-vazquez) gifted Raphinha the goal that extended Barça's lead.

Barcelona came back strongly in the second half and had several chances denied by a string of stunning saves by Courtois.

They were shocked, however, when Mbappé reduced the deficit in the 70th minute after a quick counter-attack by Vinícius, who ran up the right and put it on a plate for the [France](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=478) forward to complete his hat trick.

Yet last year's champions could not recover, leaving them on the brink of a season without silverware.

"It was obviously very important to win today. It's great to have this game after the Champions League, I think it's already forgotten," Yamal told Movistar Plus after they were knocked out of Europe in the semifinals in a heartbreaking midweek loss to Inter Milan.

"Suffering is what makes you strong and what teaches you to correct the mistakes you make. They didn't create any clear-cut chances other than the goals.

"It was very important to win today to get closer to the league title. We are delighted."
