# Barcelona edge closer to title with win over Leganés

[Barcelona](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=83) extended their lead at the top to seven points with a 1-0 win at [Leganés](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/17534/leganes) thanks to an own goal by defender [Jorge Sáenz](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/209736/jorge) on Saturday that took their unbeaten LaLiga run to 12 matches.

Hansi Flick's side moved to 70 points above second-placed [Real Madrid](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=86), who have 63 and visit Alaves on Sunday.

"For us today was a very difficult game but winning was very important. I am proud of what my team is doing in the last few weeks and months," Barça boss Flick said.

"We need to work on our defence and attack. But we've got three points and that's what's important," he added.

In a tense first half, the hosts could have taken the lead when [Dani Raba](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/253763/dani-raba)'s pass found [Adrià Altimira](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/308006/adria-altimira) in the box, but Barcelona goalkeeper [Wojciech Szczesny](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/131634/wojciech-szczesny) was on hand to deny him.

Barça also threatened when [Jules Koundé](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231692/jules-kounde) beat Saenz to the ball before firing wide.

The deadlock was finally broken after the break when Barca took the lead after [Raphinha](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231050/raphinha)'s cross for [Robert Lewandowski](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/125824/robert-lewandowski) was inadvertently deflected into the net by Leganes defender Sáenz.

Lewandowski, chasing his 100th goal for the Catalans, later saw his header from another Raphinha's centre go wide before he was replaced by [Ferran Torres](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265869/ferran-torres) after 67 minutes.

The hosts looked to have levelled when Dani Raba headed home Adria Altimira's cross but the goal was disallowed for offside.

Barcelona had a few more attempts, the clearest coming when [Lamine Yamal](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/362150/lamine-yamal) combined with Torres but the former was unable to capitalise.

Leganes were desperate to get back into the game but the closest they came was a long-range effort from [Diego García](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/395376/diego-garcia) that missed the target.

The relegation-threatened side remain second from bottom on 28 points, two points off the safety zone.

Barça, who are unbeaten in 24 games across all competitions, visit [Borussia Dortmund](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=124) in their Champions League quarterfinal second leg on Tuesday having won the first game 4-0.

They will then host [Celta Vigo](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=85) in LaLiga on Saturday.
