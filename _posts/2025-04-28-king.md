# Barcelona edge Real Madrid in ET thriller to win Copa del Rey

A [Jules Koundé](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231692/jules-kounde) goal in the dying minutes of extra time handed [Barcelona](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=83) a dramatic 3-2 win over fierce rivals [Real Madrid](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=86) in an enthralling [Copa del Rey](https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ESP.COPA_DEL_REY) final in a raucous atmosphere at Seville's La Cartuja stadium Saturday.

Barça won a record-extending 32nd Spanish Cup title thanks to a stunning strike from the French defender, who pounced on a pass by [Brahim Díaz](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/246532/brahim-diaz) and slotted a shot into the low corner of Thibaut Courtois' net from 25 yards for the 116th-minute winner.

The match ended on a sour note for Real Madrid, as Antonio Rüdiger and Lucas Vázquez, both on the bench after being substituted earlier, received red cards for dissent from the sidelines, with Jude Bellingham also being flashed a red after the final whistle for unsportsmanlike conduct.

[Pedri](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/250465/pedri) put them ahead in the 28th minute with a brilliant curling strike into the top corner from outside the box in a first half dominated by Barca.

However, Madrid took control in the second half as [Kylian Mbappé](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231388/kylian-mbappe), who was absent from the starting XI as he has yet to regain full fitness from an ankle injury, came off the bench to score the equaliser from a free kick in the 70th minute.

[Aurélien Tchouaméni](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265919/aurelien-tchouameni) gave Real Madrid the lead seven minutes later with a towering header from a corner before [Ferran Torres](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265869/ferran-torres) found the equaliser in a counterattack in the 84th minute that took the game to extra time.

Just when it seemed like the title would be settled in a penalty shootout, Koundé scored the winner that earned Barça the title and the first step in a potential treble.

Barcelona will carry this momentum into Wednesday's first leg of their Champions League semifinal against Inter Milan. They also lead LaLiga by four points over Madrid.

"It was a good time to give the fans something to cheer about. Let's enjoy it, but don't overdo it because the Champions League semifinals are coming up in a few days," player of the match [Ferran Torres](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265869/ferran-torres) told TVE.

"Happy and tired. Without a doubt, it was the most physically demanding game I've played in my life. But we're a great team who never gives up.

"It tastes better that way, especially when it's Real Madrid in front of us."

It was a nail-biting, ill-tempered encounter fueled by Friday's turmoil ignited after Real Madrid decided to boycott prematch activities in protest against the Spanish FA's refereeing.

Final official Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, who had given an emotional prematch news conference on Friday, was faced with a series of challenging decisions, including an extra-time penalty for Barcelona that was eventually overturned following a lengthy VAR review.

Barcelona dominated the first half, with Pedri opening the scoring in the 28th minute with a fine curling shot into the top corner. Torres also had a header hit the post just before halftime, marking a one-sided first half in which Real Madrid, lacking in form, were fortunate to be trailing by only a goal.

In an attempt to swing the momentum, Ancelotti brought on Mbappé to replace the ineffectual [Rodrygo](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/267804/rodrygo). The French forward changed the dynamic of the game, creating numerous problems for Barcelona with his high-paced combinations with [Vinicius Junior](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/252107/vinicius-junior).

Despite two clear chances from Vinicius Junior being denied by stunning saves from [Wojciech Szczesny](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/131634/wojciech-szczesny), Mbappé managed to find the back of the net in the 69th minute with a low strike from a free kick.

Just as Barcelona appeared to be on the back foot and Real Madrid were gaining control, Torres equalised in the 83rd minute. This set the stage for a dramatic conclusion, with Barcelona securing the winner to the euphoria of their fans.

Barcelona have beaten Madrid in all three of their clásicos this season. They routed Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup final in January after winning 4-0 at Madrid in LaLiga in October.

The loss to their fierce rivals is another blow to Madrid after they were knocked out of the Champions League quarterfinals by [Arsenal](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=359). This could have been its last final with Carlo Ancelotti in charge. The Italian coach said he will decide his future this summer amid speculation he is bound to take over [Brazil](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=205).
