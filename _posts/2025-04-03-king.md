# Barcelona beat Atletico to set up cup final against Real Madrid

MADRID, April 2 - [Barcelona](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/83) will face fierce rivals [Real Madrid](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/86) in a mouth-watering Copa del Rey final after they beat [Atlético Madrid](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/1068/atletico-madrid) 1-0 at a feverish Metropolitano Stadium on Wednesday to complete a 5-4 aggregate win.

Following an eight-goal thriller in the first leg of the semi-final in Barcelona, [Ferran Torres](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265869/Ferran-Torres)'s effort from inside the box in the 27th minute was enough to earn the Catalan side a win in the Spanish capital that booked their ticket to the final in Seville later this month.

Torres was freed through the middle by [Lamine Yamal](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/362150/Lamine-Yamal) and took the ball in his stride before striking a low shot into the bottom left corner past keeper [Juan Musso](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/177927/Juan-Musso).

Atletico pushed for the equaliser in the second half, with substitute Alexander Sorloth missing a sitter from close range, but Barca held on to secure a narrow win.

After Real Madrid fought back to snatch a rip-roaring 4-4 draw against [Real Sociedad](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/89) on Tuesday for a 5-4 aggregate win, Wednesday's result set up a Clasico between Real and Barca in the Cup final, something that has not happened for over a decade.

Real and Barca have met in the Copa del Rey final on 18 occasions with Real leading the rivalry with 11 wins, including a 2-1 triumph in the 2014 final in [Valencia](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/94).

Barcelona thrashed Real both times they met this season, a 4-0 win at Santiago Bernabeu in LaLiga in October and a 5-2 victory in the Spanish Super Cup final in [Saudi Arabia](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/655) in January.

Both sides are still in contention for three trophies this season as they are through to the Champions League quarter-finals and going head-to-head in what seems to be a two-horse race for the LaLiga title.

Barcelona are top of the LaLiga standings with 66 points, three ahead of Real, with third-placed Atletico six further points back in the title race with nine games left.

Real will travel to London to face [Arsenal](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/359) in the Champions League quarter-finals next week while Barca will host [Borussia Dortmund](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/124). They will meet in the final on April 26 at La Cartuja Stadium.
