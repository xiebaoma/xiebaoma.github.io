# Barcelona clinch 28th LaLiga title with victory over Espanyol

[Barcelona](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=83) secured their 28th LaLiga title on Thursday when they beat city rivals [Espanyol](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=88) 2-0, securing an unassailable seven-point lead over second-placed [Real Madrid](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=86) with two games left to play.

Following a 4-3 loss at Barcelona on Sunday, Madrid needed to win their final three games and hope the leaders didn't earn more than one point in the same period to maintain any mathematical chance of claiming the title.

However, their slim title hopes were dashed when [Lamine Yamal](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/362150/lamine-yamal) curled a superb shot into the back of the net in the 53rd minute, with [Fermín López](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/354334/fermin-lopez) securing the victory by striking a ball from inside the box, assisted by Yamal, five minutes deep in stoppage time.

The result moved Hansi Flick's Barca to 85 points, seven ahead of last season's champions Madrid, with Atlético Madrid third on 70 points. It caps a remarkable first season at Barça for coach Hansi Flick as his side have won the LaLiga and [Copa del Rey](https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ESP.COPA_DEL_REY) double.

The Catalan side said they will be presented with the league trophy on Friday during a special celebration in the city.

Barça were seconds away from celebrating the title without stepping on the pitch on Wednesday until Madrid scored a late winner against [Mallorca](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=84) to keep their slim hopes alive.

But Barça took care of business themselves with a hard-fought win at Espanyol, with the match being delayed for a few minutes after several fans were injured after being hit by a car outside the stadium.

The hosts were arguably the better side in a first half that was goalless thanks to Barca goalkeeper [Wojciech Szczesny](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/131634/wojciech-szczesny) who made a brilliant reflex save to deny a Javi Puado effort from close range in one of several dangerous Espanyol counter-attacks.

Just when it seemed Barça were out of ideas on how to break down their opponents, it was teenage sensation Yamal who worked his magic, scoring a stunning goal with what is becoming his trademark move.

The 17-year-old took the ball on the right touchline and made a superb lateral run parallel to the edge of the box before unleashing a curling strike between two defenders and into the top corner.

"Lamine's goal is a move he practices a lot, he had scored twice today in the warm-up the same way. We have to look after him and let him enjoy it, he is fantastic," his teammate [Pedri](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/250465/pedri) told Movistar Plus.

"You don't win a league every day so now we need to enjoy it and celebrate this trophy. It was one of the most complicated titles. We are happy with the year we have had. We've enjoyed it and so have the fans."

Yamal's goal worked as a confidence boost as Barça took control and, after [Leandro Cabrera](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/133259/leandro-cabrera) was sent off with a straight red for elbowing Yamal in the body in the 80th minute, substitute Lopez wrapped up the win to begin the title celebrations.
