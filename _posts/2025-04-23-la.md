# Dani Olmo strike keeps Barcelona's title charge on track

[Barcelona](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/83)'s [Dani Olmo](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/227765/Dani-Olmo) scored inside the first minute of the second half to earn a hard-fought 1-0 home win against [Mallorca](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/84) on Tuesday, extending their lead over [Real Madrid](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/86) at the top of the table to seven points with five games to go.

Barça dominated proceedings despite coach Hansi Flick deciding to rest several key starters ahead of Saturday's Copa del Rey final against bitter rivals Madrid, but Mallorca goalkeeper [Leo Roman](http://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/300926/Leo-Román) put on a show between the posts to keep them at bay.

The hosts finally managed to break the deadlock shortly after the break thanks to a fine piece of individual skill from Olmo, who took the ball in a tight space inside the box and quickly fired a left foot shot into the bottom corner before Mallorca's defenders could challenge him.

The win lifted Barça to 76 points at the top of the LaLiga standings with Madrid, who visit [Getafe](http://www.espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/2922) on Wednesday, seven points adrift with a game in hand. Mallorca are seventh, in a Europa League qualification spot, on 44 points.

"Their goalkeeper had a great game," Barcelona midfielder Gavi told Movistar Plus. "We had the chance to take advantage and took it. It's football. We insisted, worked hard, kept going and the goal finally came.

"We played a great game overall and I'm very happy for the players who stepped up."

Missing LaLiga top-scorer [Robert Lewandowski](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/125824/robert-lewandowski), who will be sidelined for the Spanish Cup final and the first leg of their Champions League semifinal against Inter Milan next week with a leg muscle injury, Flick also started with [Jules Koundé](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231692/jules-kounde), [Raphinha](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/231050/raphinha), [Pau Cubarsí](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/368992/pau-cubarsi) and [Frenkie de Jong](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219022/frenkie-de-jong) on the bench.

Barça didn't miss a beat, however, pushing [Mallorca](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=84) back from the start.

Teenager [Lamine Yamal](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/362150/lamine-yamal) was a constant menace but was denied several times by an inspired Roman, who made three stunning saves to prevent the 17-year-old [Spain](http://espn.com/soccer/team?id=164) winger giving the home side the lead.

[Ferran Torres](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265869/ferran-torres) and [Eric García](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/128714/eric-garcia) also had efforts from close range denied while [Gavi](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/323702/gavi)'s deflected strike from the edge of the box came off the post in the 28th minute, with [Ronald Araújo](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/270821/ronald-araujo) missing a sitter one minute later, firing wide from a corner.

Mallorca created a few chances on the counter with [Mateu Morey](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/265992/mateu-morey) having a goal ruled out for an offside in the buildup right before the break.

After Olmo finally gave Barca a deserved lead in the 46th minute, Mallorca's captain [Antonio Raíllo](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/222333/antonio-raillo) almost headed home the equaliser from a free kick in the 55th minute, but his effort went just wide.

After Saturday's *Clasico* in Seville, treble chasing Barca will face last-placed Valladolid before hosting Madrid in a LaLiga clash that could decide the title on May 11.
